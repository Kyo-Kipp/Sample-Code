        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Started in 2016 by its founder Kyo Woods, the company was little more than a side project with other college students during its conception. It really blossomed after his graduation when it was then adopted into a more official capacity.</p>
        <p>Because of its origins in Atlanta during the Fine Arts growth initiative, it has been featured in several of its local Gaming Associations including S.I.E.G.E. and affiliated with both GGDA and IGDA chapters.</p>
        
        <h2>Studio Focus</h2>
        <p>The Goal of this studio is to bring independent studios the workforce nessisary to propel their game to a quality to rival Triple A Studios by combining skills towards a common goal. </p>
        
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>Currently, the studio is based out of Atlanta at  6600 Peachtree Dunwoody Rd, Atlanta, GA 30328.</p>
