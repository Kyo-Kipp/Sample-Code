<p>Name: Kyo Woods</p>
<p>Age: 30</p>
<p>Ocupation: Valet</p>
<p>Hobbies: Living different lives through art mediums</p>
<p>Born to a single military mother I had the advantage of seeing foreign countries before many children learned to walk. It is this fact that makes me believe that I love to travel and seek out new places. It is this drive that lead me to seek out a college away from home. I chose Columbus Georgia. Despite the friends I made, my need to explore was not satiated. I eventually moved to Colorado where I was truly in a new land.</p>
<p>In Colorado where the air was Crisp and Sparse, everything changed. I even had to learn to breathe differently as I explored the mountains and the plains, but eventually naivety changed my path again. I followed a girl back to Atlanta.</p>
<p>Now back in Georgia and alone with this accursed humidity, I am faced with a new horizon, self-discovery and self-discipline. Back in college I now strive to make my place in the world through Art. Knowing the idiom of the starving artist I take up the mantle of artist under the guise of programmer. I craft the tools to make my worlds complete. Welcome to my workshop...
